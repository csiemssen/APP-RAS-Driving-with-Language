The vehicle is positioned on the right side of the road, facing away from the camera. It seems to be stationary or moving very slowly, as indicated by the blurred background and the lack of any significant motion blur on the vehicle itself. The streetlights and traffic lights in the background suggest that the vehicle might be stopped at an intersection or a red light."
