    "answer": "The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection with traffic lights. The current state of the traffic light is green for straight through traffic (CAM_BACK). Here are some possible actions the ego vehicle could take:\n\n1. **Continue Straight**: If the ego vehicle is in the process of turning right or left, it should continue straight to avoid stopping at the intersection.\n2. **Stop**: If the ego vehicle is stopped at the intersection, it should stop until the traffic light changes to allow it to proceed.\n\n### Why Take This Action:\n- **Safety**: Stopping at the intersection ensures that the ego vehicle does not enter the intersection while the traffic light is red, which could lead to a collision.\n- **Traffic Flow**: Continuing straight allows other vehicles to pass through the intersection without being obstructed.\n\n### Probability:\n- **Probability of Being in the Right Situation**: The probability depends on the specific scenario. For example, if the ego vehicle is about to turn right, the probability of needing to stop is relatively low because the traffic light is green.\n- **Probability of Traffic Light Changes**: The probability of the traffic light changing to red or green depends on the timing of the traffic light cycle. If the traffic light cycle is 60 seconds long, there is a 1/6"

    "answer": "To determine what actions taken by the ego vehicle could lead to a collision with the object at coordinates (C1, CAM_BACK, 1088.3, 497.5), we need to analyze the situation based on the provided information and the context of the image.\n\n### Image Analysis:\n- **Ego Vehicle**: The ego vehicle is positioned in the foreground.\n- **Object of Interest**: The object at coordinates (C1, CAM_BACK, 1088.3, 497.5) appears to be a sign or a billboard located further down the road.\n- **Traffic Light**: There is a traffic light visible in the image, which is green for the ego vehicle's lane.\n\n### Potential Actions Leading to Collision:\n1. **Failure to Observe Traffic Signals**:\n   - If the ego vehicle fails to observe the green traffic light, it may proceed into an intersection where it should stop according to traffic rules. This would lead to a potential collision with the object at the intersection.\n\n2. **Failure to Maintain Safe Distance**:\n   - If the ego vehicle does not maintain a safe distance from the object, it might collide with the sign or billboard due to insufficient stopping distance.\n\n3. **Failure to React"

    "answer": "In the scenario you described, the ego vehicle should follow these safe actions:\n\n1. **Slow Down**: The road is wet and slippery due to the rain, which increases the risk of skidding or losing control. Slowing down helps maintain better traction and reduces the likelihood of accidents.\n\n2. **Observe Traffic Lights**: The traffic lights are visible, so the ego vehicle should pay attention to them. If the light changes, it should stop and wait for the signal to change before proceeding.\n\n3. **Be Aware of Surroundings**: The wet road conditions can make it difficult to see obstacles or pedestrians. The ego vehicle should be extra cautious and vigilant about its surroundings.\n\n4. **Avoid Making Quick Decisions**: The ego vehicle should not make sudden turns or lane changes unless necessary, as this could lead to loss of control or collision with other vehicles or pedestrians.\n\n5. **Stay in Your Lane**: The ego vehicle should stay in its lane and avoid drifting into the opposite lane, which could lead to a collision.\n\n6. **Use Brakes Wisely**: The ego vehicle should use brakes gently to maintain control over the vehicle, especially when approaching intersections or other potential hazards.\n\n7. **Communicate with Other Vehicles**: If the ego vehicle is following another vehicle, it"

    "answer": "The ego vehicle is currently at a stop sign in a flooded intersection. The camera angle shows that the vehicle is facing the intersection with water covering the road. The traffic light is red, and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible.\n\nGiven this scenario, the ego vehicle should consider the following actions:\n\n1. **Slow Down and Prepare to Stop**: Since the traffic light is red, the vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop. This ensures safety and compliance with traffic rules.\n\n2. **Check for Obstacles**: The vehicle should check if there are any obstacles such as debris or submerged objects in the water that could cause a hazard.\n\n3. **Communicate with Other Vehicles**: If there are other vehicles ahead, the ego vehicle should communicate its intentions (e.g., stopping) to them through lane changes or signals.\n\n4. **Avoid Moving Forward**: Given the flooded conditions, it would be prudent to avoid moving forward unless it is necessary to maintain traffic flow or reach a destination.\n\n5. **Wait for Clearance**: If the water level is high enough to obstruct the view of the intersection, the vehicle should wait until the water recedes before proceeding.\n\n### Probability of Taking These Actions\n\n- **Probability of Slowing Down and Preparing to Stop**: High.

If the ego vehicle is following the signals correctly, it should be able to stop safely.\n   - However, if the ego vehicle is not following the signals (e.g., going straight when it should turn left), it could lead to a collision.\n\n3. **Wet Road Conditions**:\n   - Wet roads reduce traction, making"
