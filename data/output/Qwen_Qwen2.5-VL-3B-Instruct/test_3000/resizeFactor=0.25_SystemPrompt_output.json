The vehicle's headlights are on, indicating that it is likely in low visibility conditions, possibly due to rain. The vehicle is positioned slightly to the left of the center of the lane, suggesting it is maintaining its lane position. There are no immediate signs of braking or acceleration, so the vehicle seems to be proceeding normally without any sudden movements."

    "answer": "1. The ego vehicle should first notice the white car on the right side of the road. This car is stationary and parked along the curb. The ego vehicle should maintain its current speed and continue straight ahead.\n\n2. As the ego vehicle approaches the white car, it should slow down slightly to ensure a safe distance between itself and the parked car. It should also be prepared to stop if necessary due to any potential hazards such as pedestrians or other vehicles entering the intersection.\n\n3. After passing the white car, the ego vehicle should notice the red car in the middle lane. This car is moving forward and appears to be approaching the intersection."
