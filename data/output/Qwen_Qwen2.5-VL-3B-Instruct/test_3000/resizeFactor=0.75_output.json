    "question": "Predict the behavior of the ego vehicle.",
    "answer": "In rainy conditions, the ego vehicle should be cautious and drive at a slower speed to ensure safety. Here are some steps the ego vehicle can take:\n\n1. **Reduce Speed**: Slow down to avoid hydroplaning on wet roads.\n2. **Increase Following Distance**: Maintain a larger distance from other vehicles to allow for more time to react to any sudden changes in traffic.\n3. **Use Low Beams**: Turn on low-beam headlights to improve visibility while reducing glare.\n4. **Be Mindful of Pedestrians**: Ensure pedestrians are visible and give them extra space as they may be less visible due to rain.\n5."

    "answer": "The ego vehicle is a silver sedan driving on a city street. It is positioned in the left lane, following a white dashed line that marks the edge of the lane. The traffic light ahead is red, and there are no pedestrians or other vehicles visible in the immediate vicinity.\n\nBased on this information, the ego vehicle will likely come to a complete stop at the red traffic light. This is because the traffic light is red, which is typically the signal for vehicles to stop. The ego vehicle will remain stationary until the light changes to green again."

    "question": "Predict the behavior of the ego vehicle.",
    "answer": "The ego vehicle is positioned in the leftmost lane of the intersection, following the flow of traffic. It appears to be approaching a stoplight, which is currently red. Based on the traffic light signals and the surrounding vehicles' movements, it seems that the ego vehicle will likely come to a complete stop at this intersection.\n\nGiven the current traffic conditions and the red light, the ego vehicle should follow the rules of the road by stopping and waiting for the light to change before proceeding. This ensures safety for all road users, including pedestrians and other vehicles."

    "answer": "When an ego vehicle is approaching its next possible location, it should first notice the traffic cones on the left side of the road. These cones indicate a no-parking zone or a restricted area, so the ego vehicle should slow down and be cautious.\n\nThe state of the object (the traffic cones) that is first noticed by the ego vehicle is that they are orange and positioned in a row along the edge of the road. The action the ego vehicle should take is to reduce its speed and maintain a safe distance from the cones to avoid any potential hazards.\n\nNext, the ego vehicle should notice the white truck parked further down the street.

    "answer": "To answer your question, I would need more context about the scenario you're describing. However, based on common scenarios in autonomous driving, here's a general response:\n\n1. **First Object Noticed**: The ego vehicle should first notice an obstacle or object that could pose a risk to its safety, such as a pedestrian, cyclist, or another vehicle.\n\n2. **State of First Object**: This object will be detected as a static or moving object depending on its position relative to the ego vehicle. If it's stationary, it might be a sign, pole, or other fixed structure. If it's moving, it could be a pedestrian"

    "answer": "When an ego vehicle is navigating at night, it must be highly vigilant to ensure the safety of all road users. Here\u2019s how the ego vehicle should prioritize its observations:\n\n1. **First Object Noticed**: The ego vehicle should first notice the streetlights. These lights provide critical illumination for the driver, helping them see the road ahead and identify any potential hazards such as pedestrians or cyclists who might be crossing the road.\n\n2. **State of the First Object**: The streetlights are typically bright and well-lit, indicating they are functioning properly. They emit a strong light that can be seen from a distance, which helps in maintaining visibility"

The state of this object is a red circle with a white border containing the number \"40,\" indicating a speed limit of 40 kilometers per hour. The ego vehicle should slow down accordingly to ensure it adheres to the speed limit.\n\nThe second object the ego vehicle should notice is the traffic light. The state of this object is a red signal, which indicates that vehicles must stop at the intersection. The ego vehicle should come to a complete stop until the light turns green.\n\nThe third object the ego vehicle should notice is the pedestrian"

    "answer": "When an autonomous vehicle (AV) is navigating through an urban environment, it must be highly aware of its surroundings to ensure safe and efficient movement. The AV's perception system will detect various objects in its environment, including pedestrians, vehicles, and other obstacles. Here\u2019s how the AV might prioritize its observations based on typical scenarios:\n\n1. **First Object Noticed: Pedestrians**\n   - **State:** Pedestrians are typically walking or standing near the road, often in the middle of the street or crossing the road.\n   - **Action:** The AV should slow down significantly and come to a complete stop if it detects a pedestrian"

The ego vehicle should maintain its current speed and direction, ensuring it does not collide with these parked vehicles.\n\nThe second object the ego vehicle should notice is the traffic light ahead. This traffic light is crucial for determining whether it can proceed without stopping or if it needs to stop based on the signal it receives. If the traffic light is red, the ego vehicle should come to a complete stop until the light turns green. If the traffic light is"

    "answer": "To answer your question, I would need more context about the scenario you're describing. However, based on common scenarios where an ego vehicle (self-driving car) might navigate through an intersection or a roundabout, here's a general approach:\n\n1. **First Object Noticed**: The ego vehicle should first notice the traffic lights at the intersection. The state of the traffic light is either red, yellow, or green. Based on this signal, the ego vehicle will determine whether it can proceed, stop, or yield.\n\n2. **Action for First Object**: \n   - If the traffic light is red, the ego vehicle should stop.\n"
