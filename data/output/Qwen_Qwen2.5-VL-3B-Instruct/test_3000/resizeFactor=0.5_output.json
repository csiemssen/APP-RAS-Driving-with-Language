    "question": "Predict the behavior of the ego vehicle.",
    "answer": "The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection with traffic lights. The traffic light on the left side of the image is green, indicating that it is safe for vehicles to proceed. The traffic light on the right side of the image is also green, which means that it is safe for vehicles to proceed as well. Therefore, the ego vehicle should be able to proceed through the intersection safely."

    "question": "Predict the behavior of the ego vehicle.",
    "answer": "Predicting the behavior of an ego vehicle in a rainy environment involves several considerations, including visibility, traction, and potential hazards such as slippery roads or pedestrians. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach to predicting the behavior:\n\n1. **Visibility**: Rain can significantly reduce visibility, making it difficult for the ego vehicle to see other vehicles, pedestrians, or obstacles. The ego vehicle should slow down and increase its following distance to maintain a safe distance from other vehicles.\n\n2. **Traction**: Wet roads can make driving more challenging due to reduced traction. The ego vehicle should adjust its speed accordingly, possibly reducing acceleration to avoid skidding.\n\n3."

    "question": "Predict the behavior of the ego vehicle.",
    "answer": "To predict the behavior of the ego vehicle, we need to consider several factors such as traffic conditions, road signs, and potential obstacles. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Traffic Conditions**: The ego vehicle should be aware of the current traffic situation. If there is heavy traffic or congestion, it might need to slow down or wait for the traffic to clear before proceeding.\n\n2. **Road Signs**: The ego vehicle should interpret any road signs that may indicate speed limits, lane changes, or other instructions. For example, if it sees a \"slow down\" sign, it should reduce its speed accordingly.\n\n3. **Potential"

    "answer": "When an ego vehicle is navigating through an intersection, it should first notice the traffic light. The state of the traffic light is either red, yellow, or green. If the traffic light is red, the ego vehicle should come to a complete stop until the light turns green. If the traffic light is yellow, the ego vehicle should prepare to stop if the light turns red. If the traffic light is green, the ego vehicle can proceed through the intersection.\n\nThe ego vehicle should then notice the oncoming traffic. The state of the oncoming traffic is either moving or stationary. If the oncoming traffic is moving, the ego vehicle should slow"

However, based on common scenarios in autonomous vehicle (AV) applications, here's a general approach:\n\n1. **First Object Noticed**: The ego vehicle should first notice the road ahead. This is because the road provides the most direct path to the next possible location. The state of this object is that it is a clear, well-defined road with no immediate obstacles.\n\n   **Action for the Ego Vehicle**: The ego vehicle should accelerate along the road until it reaches the next intersection or the end of the visible road segment.\n\n2. **Second Object"

This is because traffic lights control the flow of traffic and can significantly impact the AV's path and speed.\n\n   - **State of the Object**: The traffic light will be stationary and will likely show either a red, yellow, or green signal.\n   - **Action**: If the traffic light shows red, the AV should come to a complete stop."

    "answer": "When an ego vehicle is navigating at night, it must be highly vigilant and aware of its surroundings to ensure safety. Here\u2019s how the ego vehicle should prioritize its observations:\n\n1. **First Object to Notice**: The ego vehicle should first notice the road ahead. This is crucial because the road provides the path forward and helps maintain lane discipline. The state of this object is that it is a well-defined, illuminated path with visible lane markings. The action the ego vehicle should take is to continue driving straight on the road.\n\n2. **Second Object to Notice**: After ensuring it is on the correct lane, the ego vehicle should then notice any"

The pedestrian crossing sign is typically red with white text and symbols indicating a pedestrian crossing ahead. \n\n**Action for the Ego Vehicle:**\n- **Stop:** The ego vehicle should come to a complete stop at the pedestrian crossing sign. This ensures that any pedestrians have time to cross safely.\n\nNext, the ego vehicle should notice the pedestrian walking towards the right side of the road. The pedestrian is likely carrying an umbrella, which can be seen clearly against the background of trees and the overcast sky.\n\n"
