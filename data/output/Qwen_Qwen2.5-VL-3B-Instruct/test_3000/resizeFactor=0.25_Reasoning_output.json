    "question": "Predict the behavior of the ego vehicle.",
    "answer": "To predict the behavior of an ego vehicle, we need to consider several factors such as the current state of the vehicle (e.g., speed, acceleration, braking), the environment (e.g., traffic, pedestrians, obstacles), and the goals or intentions of the driver or other road users. Here's a step-by-step approach to predicting the behavior:\n\n1. **Current State**: The ego vehicle's current speed, acceleration, and braking should be determined based on its sensors (e.g., LIDAR, radar, cameras). This information helps in understanding the vehicle's immediate capabilities.\n\n2. **Environmental Factors**: Analyze the surrounding environment"

This includes both static objects like parked cars and moving objects like bicycles or pedestrians.\n\n2. **State of First Object**: The state of the first object noticed will depend on whether it is stationary or moving. If stationary, the ego vehicle should assess its size, color,"

    "answer": "When an ego vehicle is navigating through an urban environment, it's crucial to prioritize safety and visibility. Here\u2019s how the ego vehicle should prioritize its observations:\n\n1. **First Object to Notice**: The ego vehicle should first notice the pedestrian crossing sign on the sidewalk. This is because pedestrians often cross streets at intersections or near crosswalks, and the presence of this sign indicates that pedestrians may be nearby. The state of the object (the pedestrian crossing sign) is clearly visible and stationary.\n\n   **Action**: The ego vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop if necessary, ensuring it has enough time to react to any potential pedestrian movement.\n\n"

    "answer": "To answer your question, I would need more context about the scenario you're describing. However, based on common scenarios in autonomous vehicle (AV) applications, here's a general approach:\n\n1. **First Object Noticed**: The ego vehicle should first notice the traffic lights at the intersection. This is because traffic lights are critical for ensuring safe and efficient navigation through intersections.\n\n   - **State of the Object**: The traffic light will be in a state where it is either red, yellow, or green.\n   - **Action**: If the traffic light is red, the ego vehicle should come to a complete stop. If it is yellow,"

    "answer": "When an ego vehicle is approaching a potential destination, it should first notice the \"AHEAD\" sign on the road. This sign indicates the direction and distance to the next possible location. The state of the \"AHEAD\" sign is clearly visible and stationary, which allows the ego vehicle to perceive its position relative to the road markings.\n\nAction for the ego vehicle:\n- **First Action:** Continue straight ahead along the road, following the \"AHEAD\" sign.\n\nNext, the ego vehicle should notice the yellow taxi in the middle of the road. The state of the yellow taxi is moving, indicating it is actively driving down the street.\n\n"
