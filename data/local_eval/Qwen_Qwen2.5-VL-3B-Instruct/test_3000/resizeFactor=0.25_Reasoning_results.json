Here\u2019s a step-by-step analysis based on the image:\n\n1. **Traffic Rules**: The image shows a four-lane road with no visible traffic signals or signs indicating specific lanes for vehicles. However, in many places, it's common to see traffic rules like lane markings that indicate which lane is for left turns, right turns, or straight ahead.\n\n2. **Weather Conditions**: The sky appears overcast with clouds",
