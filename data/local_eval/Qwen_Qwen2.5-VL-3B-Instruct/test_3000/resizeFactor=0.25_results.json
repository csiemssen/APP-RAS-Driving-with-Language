However, based on common scenarios in autonomous vehicle (AV) systems, here's a general approach:\n\n1. **First Object Noticed**: The ego vehicle should first notice the traffic light at the intersection. This is because traffic lights are critical for controlling the flow of traffic and ensuring safety.\n\n   - **State of the Traffic Light**: The traffic light will be in one of three states: red, yellow, or green.\n   - **Action**: If the traffic light is red, the ego vehicle should come to a complete stop.
