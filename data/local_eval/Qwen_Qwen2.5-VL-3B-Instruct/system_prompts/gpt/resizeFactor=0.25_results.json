            "question": "What actions could the ego vehicle take based on <c1,CAM_BACK,1088.3,497.5>? Why take this action and what's the probability?",
            "GT": "The action is to keep going at the same speed. The reason is to follow the traffic rules, which has a high probability.",
            "answer": "The ego vehicle is approaching an intersection with traffic lights. The current state of the traffic light is green for straight through traffic (CAM_BACK). Here are some possible actions the ego vehicle could take:\n\n1. **Continue Straight**: If the ego vehicle is in the process of turning right or left, it should continue straight to avoid stopping at the intersection.\n2. **Stop**: If the ego vehicle is stopped at the intersection, it should stop until the traffic light changes to allow it to proceed.\n\n### Why Take This Action:\n- **Safety**: Stopping at the intersection ensures that the ego vehicle does not enter the intersection while the traffic light is red, which could lead to a collision.\n- **Traffic Flow**: Continuing straight allows other vehicles to pass through the intersection without being obstructed.\n\n### Probability:\n- **Probability of Being in the Right Situation**: The probability depends on the specific scenario. For example, if the ego vehicle is about to turn right, the probability of needing to stop is relatively low because the traffic light is green.\n- **Probability of Traffic Light Changes**: The probability of the traffic light changing to red or green depends on the timing of the traffic light cycle. If the traffic light cycle is 60 seconds long, there is a 1/6",

            "GT": "Keep going at the same speed, decelerate gradually without braking.",
            "answer": "In the scenario you described, the ego vehicle should follow these safe actions:\n\n1. **Slow Down**: The road is wet and slippery due to the rain, which increases the risk of skidding or losing control. Slowing down helps maintain better traction and reduces the likelihood of accidents.\n\n2. **Observe Traffic Lights**: The traffic lights are visible, so the ego vehicle should pay attention to them. If the light changes, it should stop and wait for the signal to change before proceeding.\n\n3. **Be Aware of Surroundings**: The wet road conditions can make it difficult to see obstacles or pedestrians. The ego vehicle should be extra cautious and vigilant about its surroundings.\n\n4. **Avoid Making Quick Decisions**: The ego vehicle should not make sudden turns or lane changes unless necessary, as this could lead to loss of control or collision with other vehicles or pedestrians.\n\n5. **Stay in Your Lane**: The ego vehicle should stay in its lane and avoid drifting into the opposite lane, which could lead to a collision.\n\n6. **Use Brakes Wisely**: The ego vehicle should use brakes gently to maintain control over the vehicle, especially when approaching intersections or other potential hazards.\n\n7. **Communicate with Other Vehicles**: If the ego vehicle is following another vehicle, it",

            "answer": "The ego vehicle is currently at a stop sign in a flooded intersection. The camera angle shows that the vehicle is facing the intersection with water covering the road. The traffic light is red, and there are no other vehicles or pedestrians visible.\n\nGiven this scenario, the ego vehicle should consider the following actions:\n\n1. **Slow Down and Prepare to Stop**: Since the traffic light is red, the vehicle should slow down and prepare to stop. This ensures safety and compliance with traffic rules.\n\n2. **Check for Obstacles**: The vehicle should check if there are any obstacles such as debris or submerged objects in the water that could cause a hazard.\n\n3. **Communicate with Other Vehicles**: If there are other vehicles ahead, the ego vehicle should communicate its intentions (e.g., stopping) to them through lane changes or signals.\n\n4. **Avoid Moving Forward**: Given the flooded conditions, it would be prudent to avoid moving forward unless it is necessary to maintain traffic flow or reach a destination.\n\n5. **Wait for Clearance**: If the water level is high enough to obstruct the view of the intersection, the vehicle should wait until the water recedes before proceeding.\n\n### Probability of Taking These Actions\n\n- **Probability of Slowing Down and Preparing to Stop**: High.

            "answer": "In a scenario where an ego vehicle is navigating through a flooded area, it's crucial to take several safety precautions to avoid hazards and ensure the vehicle's operation. Here are some safe actions to take:\n\n1. **Slow Down**: Reduce speed to a level that allows you to react quickly to any changes in the road conditions.\n\n2. **Stay on the Right Lane**: If possible, stay in the right lane to avoid getting stuck in deeper water or debris.\n\n3. **Avoid Deep Water**: Do not drive into deep water as it can cause the vehicle to sink or become stuck.\n\n4. **Check for Obstacles**: Look out for submerged objects like trees, rocks, or other vehicles that could be dangerous.\n\n5. **Use Low Gear**: If you need to drive through water, use low gear to reduce the risk of engine damage from water intake.\n\n6. **Be Mindful of Traffic**: Be aware of other vehicles and pedestrians, especially if they are also navigating the flooded area.\n\n7. **Communicate with Others**: Inform other drivers and pedestrians about your intentions and current status.\n\n8. **Monitor Your Vehicle**: Keep an eye on your vehicle\u2019s performance; if you notice any unusual noises or vibrations, stop immediately.\n\n9. **Follow Instructions**: If you encounter",
